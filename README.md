#### Otterly Awesome Bot!

It's 2019 and we are still using the same old tiny boring emoji sizes since the dawn of the emoji. Don't you think it's time for some bigger and better emojis? Well we did and now OtterBot is here!

##### Well what does it do?

OtterBot allows you to link to your own hosted images and use them as emojis on Discord servers.

##### How to install this awesome bot.

1. Download the image for Docker.

```
docker pull khaosorg/otterbot
```

2. Get your Discord bot token and place it in a config.json file as so;

```javascript
{
  "token": "YourToken",
  "prefix":  "!o",
  "commands": {
    "dockerhub": {
      "imagenotify": {
        "loginToken": "<Your Dockerhub Login Token Here>",
        "imageuser": "user to monitor",
        "imagename": "artifact to monitor",
        "interval": 10, 
        "destServer": "<Discord server ID (Guild ID)>",
        "destChannel": "<Discord channel ID>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

imagenotify config:

	This monitors Dockerhub checking for updates to a specific image as configured. Configuration details are as follows:
  
		loginToken : Dockerhub API login token in text form
		imageuser : owner of the image to monitor, typically the part before the "/" in an image artifact reference 
		imagename : name of the artifact, typically the part after the "/" in an image artifact reference
		interval : minutes between checks
		destServer : Discord server ID (Guild ID). Notifications will be published here. 
      To find this for your server, turn on Discord debug mode, and right click on the server. Select "Copy ID"
		destChannel : Discord channel ID. Notifications will be published to this channel. 
      As above, to find this, turn on Discord debug mode, right click the channel, and select "Copy ID"

3. Map your newly created config.json file to the docker volume;

```
/path/to/your/config.json:/usr/app/src/config.json
```

4. Start your Docker container and enjoy the future of emojis!
